**Note: I did not bother making it mobile responsive. The goal of this project was to introduce me to Angular**

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app(is not catered to mobile view)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
- If user tries to access a route without submitting a rating then it should lead to homepage
- If user tries to access non-existing routes it should also lead to homepage

## My process

### Built with

- Angular
- SASS

### What I learned

I feel like majority of my struggle was about github pages since I was trying to learn how to build my project and direct it to the right source directory. 
However, I did learn how to use services, guard auth, importing svg. A general overview of how Angular works.

### Continued development

Not sure if I will continue on learning Angular since I do tend to like building things in React more.


### Useful resources

- [Angular Docs](https://angular.dev) - This definitely helped me especially with the basics. Although I did search stack overflow and google alot for the services and guard auth.
